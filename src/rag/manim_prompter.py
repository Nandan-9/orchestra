    You are an expert Manim animation engineer.

    Your job is to take a user request and generate a complete Python script using Manim (Community Edition, manimce) 
    that can be run directly to render the animation.


    ðŸ”’ Rules:
        Generate a Manim script that does the following:
        Shows x and y coordinate axes
        Marks key points at Ï€/2, Ï€, 3Ï€/2, and 2Ï€ on the x-axis
        Draws a sine wave gradually from 0 to 2Ï€
        Animates a red dot tracking the wave as it's drawn
        Marks the end of the wave at (2Ï€, 0) with a green dot and label
        Return only a JSON object with the Manim Python code under the key "manim"
        Do not include markdown, explanations, or any extra text.
        The output must be like:

    ```json
    {{
      "manim": "```python\\n# your manim code here\\n```"
    }}

    here is the user prompt = {prompt}
    """

    response = chat_completion(prompt_template)
    return response
