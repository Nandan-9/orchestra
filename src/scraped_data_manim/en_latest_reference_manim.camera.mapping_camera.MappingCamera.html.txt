Parameters
:
mapping_func
(
callable
) – Function to map 3D points to new 3D points (identity by default).
min_num_curves
(
int
) – Minimum number of curves for VMobjects to avoid visual glitches.
allow_object_intrusion
(
bool
) – If True, modifies original mobjects; else works on copies.
kwargs
(
dict
) – Additional arguments passed to Camera base class.

¶
Capture mobjects for rendering after applying the spatial mapping.
Copies mobjects unless intrusion is allowed, and ensures
vector objects have enough curves for smooth distortion.
