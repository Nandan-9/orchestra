Bases:
Camera
A camera that follows and matches the size and position of its ‘frame’, a Rectangle (or similar Mobject).
The frame defines the region of space the camera displays and can move or resize dynamically.
See also
MovingCameraScene
Frame is a Mobject, (should almost certainly be a rectangle)
determining which region of space the camera displays
Methods
auto_zoom
Zooms on to a given array of mobjects (or a singular mobject) and automatically resizes to frame all the mobjects.
cache_cairo_context
Since the frame can be moving around, the cairo context used for updating should be regenerated at each frame.
capture_mobjects
Capture mobjects by printing them on
pixel_array
.
get_cached_cairo_context
Since the frame can be moving around, the cairo context used for updating should be regenerated at each frame.
get_mobjects_indicating_movement
Returns all mobjects whose movement implies that the camera should think of all other mobjects on the screen as moving
Attributes
background_color
background_opacity
frame_center
Returns the centerpoint of the frame in cartesian coordinates.
frame_height
Returns the height of the frame.
frame_width
Returns the width of the frame

[source]
¶
Zooms on to a given array of mobjects (or a singular mobject)
and automatically resizes to frame all the mobjects.
Note
This method only works when 2D-objects in the XY-plane are considered, it
will not work correctly when the camera has been rotated.
Parameters
:
mobjects
(
Iterable
[
Mobject
]
) – The mobject or array of mobjects that the camera will focus on.
margin
(
float
) – The width of the margin that is added to the frame (optional, 0 by default).
only_mobjects_in_frame
(
bool
) – If set to
True
, only allows focusing on mobjects that are already in frame.
animate
(
bool
) – If set to
False
, applies the changes instead of returning the corresponding animation
Returns
:
_AnimationBuilder that zooms the camera view to a given list of mobjects
or ScreenRectangle with position and size updated to zoomed position.
Return type
:
Union
[_AnimationBuilder,
ScreenRectangle
]
cache_cairo_context
(
pixel_array
,
ctx
)
[source]
¶
Since the frame can be moving around, the cairo
context used for updating should be regenerated
at each frame.  So no caching.
Parameters
:
pixel_array
(
PixelArray
)
ctx
(
Context
)
Return type
:
None
capture_mobjects
(
mobjects
,
**
kwargs
)
[source]
¶
Capture mobjects by printing them on
pixel_array
.
This is the essential function that converts the contents of a Scene
into an array, which is then converted to an image or video.
Parameters
:
mobjects
(
Iterable
[
Mobject
]
) – Mobjects to capture.
kwargs
(
Any
) – Keyword arguments to be passed to
get_mobjects_to_display()
.
Return type
:
None
